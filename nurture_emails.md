## Email 1: Scott Haidarian

**Subject:** Congrats on the Backblaze move, Scott!

Hi Scott,

Congratulations on your recent move to Backblaze as Sr. Commissions Analyst! Making the jump from Certinia is a big step — especially exciting to see you continue to build depth in the sales operations and commissions space.

I've been following your career progression from your Salesforce and Bill.com days, and it's clear you've built some serious expertise in CRM systems, commissions modeling, and sales analytics. As you settle into Backblaze, I'm curious: are you still focused on deepening your technical chops in sales ops and compensation? Or are you starting to think about broader revenue operations leadership, GTM strategy, or even moving into a Director-level role?

I'd love to stay aligned with where you're headed so I can share opportunities and insights that are actually relevant to your next chapter.

In the meantime, I thought you might find these articles interesting:

Congratulations again, Scott — excited to see what you build there!

## Email 2: Christopher Toolsee

**Subject:** Checking in on your next move, Christopher

Hi Christopher,

I hope you're doing well! I saw you've been at SS&C Technologies as Financial Reporting Manager for over 5 years now — that's impressive tenure, especially in today's market. Given your deep expertise in financial reporting, GAAP compliance, and working with complex multi-billion dollar fund structures, I imagine you've built quite a reputation there.

As someone who's gone from Fund Accountant → Senior Analyst → Manager, you've clearly demonstrated upward momentum. I'm curious: are you looking to continue growing in financial reporting (VP of Financial Reporting, Controller track)? Or are you exploring broader finance leadership like FP&A, strategic finance, or CFO path?

I'd love to understand your thinking so I can keep you in mind for the right opportunities — whether that's now or down the road.

In the meantime, I thought these might resonate with you:

**[Meet Kong's New CFO, Chirag Shah!](https://konghq.com/blog/news/new-cfo-chirag-shah)**
An inside look at Kong's CFO and his career journey — great perspective if you're thinking about the executive finance track.

**[5 Career Lessons from Kong's Rock-Star AEs](https://konghq.com/blog/news/5-career-lessons-from-kong-sales)**
While this is sales-focused, the career progression principles apply beautifully to any function — especially the part about sustained performance vs. overnight promotions.

**[Hello World: Meet the Engineers Behind Kong Konnect](https://konghq.com/blog/engineering/meet-the-engineers-behind-konnect)**
Interesting read on how high-growth tech companies structure their teams and operations. As a finance leader, understanding how product/engineering teams operate is increasingly valuable.

If you'd like to chat through your next career move — or just want to brainstorm — I'm always happy to carve out 15-20 minutes. No pressure, just happy to be a sounding board.

Looking forward to staying connected, Christopher!

Best,
[Your Name]

## Email 3: George O'Brien

**Subject:** How's Zoom treating you, George?

Hi George,

Hope you're doing great! I've been meaning to reach out since I saw you landed at Zoom as Customer Success Operations Manager back in late 2020 — that's over 4 years now, which is a solid run, especially during Zoom's explosive growth phase.

Given your background in workforce management, call center operations, and now customer success ops, you've built a unique skill set that bridges operations, people leadership, and strategic execution. I'm curious: as you continue to build at Zoom, are you looking to deepen your expertise in CS Ops? Or are you starting to think about broader roles — VP of Customer Success, Chief Customer Officer, or even GM/revenue operations leadership?

I'd love to stay tuned into your goals so I can share things that are genuinely useful (opportunities, insights, or just good reads).

Speaking of which, here are a few pieces I thought you'd appreciate:

**[5 Career Lessons from Kong's Rock-Star AEs](https://konghq.com/blog/news/5-career-lessons-from-kong-sales)**
Really strong career advice from top performers — a lot of it translates perfectly to customer success and ops roles.

**[Hello World: Meet the Engineers Behind Kong Konnect](https://konghq.com/blog/engineering/meet-the-engineers-behind-konnect)**
Since you work with cross-functional teams and tools like Gainsight, this behind-the-scenes look at how high-performing product/eng teams operate might give you some good ideas.

**[Kong Expands Bay Area Headquarters](https://konghq.com/blog/news/kong-expands-bay-area-headquarters)**
You mentioned you're in Sacramento — thought you'd be interested to see how tech companies are growing and investing in the region (Kong just expanded their Bay Area HQ).

**[Life at Kong: Forging Global and Real Connections](https://konghq.com/blog/news/life-at-kong-global-connections)**
Great reflection on building strong team culture in distributed/remote environments — super relevant given your people management background.

If you ever want to grab 15 minutes to chat about where you're headed (or just compare notes on CS ops challenges), I'd love to connect.

Keep crushing it at Zoom, George!

Best,
[Your Name]
