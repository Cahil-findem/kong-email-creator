Subject: How's Zoom treating you, George?

Hi George,

Hope you're doing great! I've been meaning to reach out since I saw you landed at Zoom as Customer Success Operations Manager back in late 2020 — that's over 4 years now, which is a solid run, especially during Zoom's explosive growth phase.

Given your background in workforce management, call center operations, and now customer success ops, you've built a unique skill set that bridges operations, people leadership, and strategic execution. I'm curious: as you continue to build at Zoom, are you looking to deepen your expertise in CS Ops? Or are you starting to think about broader roles — VP of Customer Success, Chief Customer Officer, or even GM/revenue operations leadership?

I'd love to stay tuned into your goals so I can share things that are genuinely useful (opportunities, insights, or just good reads).

Speaking of which, here are a few pieces I thought you'd appreciate:

Keep crushing it at Zoom, George!

Best,
[Your Name]
