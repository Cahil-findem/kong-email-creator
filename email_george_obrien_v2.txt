Subject: How's Zoom treating you, George?

Hi George,

Hope you're doing great! I've been meaning to reach out since I saw you landed at Zoom as Customer Success Operations Manager back in late 2020 — that's over 4 years now, which is a solid run, especially during Zoom's explosive growth phase.

Given your background in workforce management, call center operations, and now customer success ops, you've built a unique skill set that bridges operations, people leadership, and strategic execution. I'm curious: as you continue to build at Zoom, are you looking to deepen your expertise in CS Ops? Or are you starting to think about broader roles — VP of Customer Success, Chief Customer Officer, or even GM/revenue operations leadership?

I'd love to stay tuned into your goals so I can share things that are genuinely useful (opportunities, insights, or just good reads).

Speaking of which, here are a few pieces I thought you'd appreciate:

Interesting look at what makes high-performing teams thrive — especially the focus on employee engagement, which I know is a big part of your role at Zoom.

Community Call Starts Out Kong Strong

Since you're focused on customer engagement and building community, thought you'd enjoy this perspective on how Kong builds and nurtures their developer community.

If you ever want to grab 15 minutes to chat about where you're headed (or just compare notes on CS ops challenges), I'd love to connect.

Keep crushing it at Zoom, George!

Best,
[Your Name]
