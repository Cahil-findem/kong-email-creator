Subject: Congrats on the Backblaze move, Scott!

Hi Scott,

Congratulations on your recent move to Backblaze as Sr. Commissions Analyst! Making the jump from Certinia is a big step — especially exciting to see you continue to build depth in the sales operations and commissions space.

I've been following your career progression from your Salesforce and Bill.com days, and it's clear you've built some serious expertise in CRM systems, commissions modeling, and sales analytics. As you settle into Backblaze, I'm curious: are you still focused on deepening your technical chops in sales ops and compensation? Or are you starting to think about broader revenue operations leadership, GTM strategy, or even moving into a Director-level role?

I'd love to stay aligned with where you're headed so I can share opportunities and insights that are actually relevant to your next chapter.

In the meantime, I thought you might find these articles interesting:
