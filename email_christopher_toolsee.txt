Subject: Checking in on your next move, Christopher

Hi Christopher,

I hope you're doing well! I saw you've been at SS&C Technologies as Financial Reporting Manager for over 5 years now — that's impressive tenure, especially in today's market. Given your deep expertise in financial reporting, GAAP compliance, and working with complex multi-billion dollar fund structures, I imagine you've built quite a reputation there.

As someone who's gone from Fund Accountant → Senior Analyst → Manager, you've clearly demonstrated upward momentum. I'm curious: are you looking to continue growing in financial reporting (VP of Financial Reporting, Controller track)? Or are you exploring broader finance leadership like FP&A, strategic finance, or CFO path?

I'd love to understand your thinking so I can keep you in mind for the right opportunities — whether that's now or down the road.

In the meantime, I thought these might resonate with you:
